# ADVANCED_DATABASE_SYSTEMS
ADVANCED DATABASE SYSTEMS - SQL Apartment Rental Database

The project includes: Database Design (Table Specifications) - Evaluation (Test Plan) - Database Development (Script Files)

DDL (Data Definition Language) commands were used to define the database schema. We create and modify the structure of the database, such as creating, altering, and dropping tables, indexes, and other database objects.

DQL (Data Query Language) commands were used to retrieve data from the database. They are used to read data and are used to select, retrieve and view the data from tables.

DML (Data Modification Language) commands were used to modify data in the database. They are used to insert, update and delete data in tables.

TCL (Transaction Control Language) commands were used to manage transactions in the database. They are used to control the undo and redo actions. Examples include: COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT.
