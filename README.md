# ADVANCED_DATABASE_SYSTEMS

### Overview

The coursework focuses on creating, managing, and evaluating a database system intended for administrating an apartment rental business based in Greece. It demands a comprehensive understanding of business rules, development of database specifications, creation of script files, and meticulous evaluation of the database through a detailed test plan. The project encapsulates:

- **Database Design** (Table Specifications)
- **Evaluation** (Test Plan)
- **Database Development** (Script Files)

### Key Components and Technologies Employed

1. **DDL (Data Definition Language) Commands**: Utilized for defining the database schema, which includes creating, altering, and dropping tables, indexes, and other database objects.
   
2. **DQL (Data Query Language) Commands**: Employed for retrieving data from the database. These commands facilitate selecting, retrieving, and viewing data from tables.
   
3. **DML (Data Modification Language) Commands**: Utilized for modifying data in the database, including inserting, updating, and deleting data in tables.
   
4. **TCL (Transaction Control Language) Commands**: Used to manage transactions within the database, controlling undo and redo operations through commands like COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT.

### [Database Description](#Database-Description)
- **Objective**: Develop a database to manage owners, apartments, tenants, rentals, and apartment reviews, adhering to specific business rules for managing and identifying entities and their attributes.

### Tasks
##### [Task 1: Table Specifications](#Task-1)
- Develop a table with appropriate attributes, ensuring adherence to the provided Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).

##### [Task 2: Script Files](#Task-2)
- Create script files for various operations like creating tables, adding constraints, inserting commands, dropping tables, and performing diverse queries, maintaining data integrity and relevance.

### Evaluation
- Document and evaluate all database elements, ensuring alignment with the test plan provided in the coursework file, and including relevant documentation for each step and operation.

### Additional Information and Tasks
- The database is developed using SQL and Oracle.
- While the database design is minimal, the emphasis of the evaluation is on testing and practical application of database management concepts.
